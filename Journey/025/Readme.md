# How to create EBS volunme snapshot using boto3?

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è Boto3 is AWS Python SDK. It allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS resources from pythonn scripts. Fun fact: AWS Cli uses boto itself. An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time copy of your Amazon EBS volume, which is lazily copied to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). EBS snapshots are incremental copies of data. This means that only unique blocks of EBS volume data that have changed since the last EBS snapshot are stored in the next EBS snapshot
