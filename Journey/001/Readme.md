# Create a new CMK in KMS and encrypt an object

## Cloud Research
- What is a Hardware Security Module (HSM)? 

- What is the difference between multi-tenant and single-tenant HSM?

- What is KSM? Key Management Service is a regional and  public service that occupies the AWS public zone. It creates, stores, and manages Symmetric as well as Asymmetric cryptographic keys meaning these keys are used to convert plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. Keys will never leave KMS however, KMS creates keys, keys can be imported, and it manage keys to perform encrypt or decrypt operations. KMS provides FIPS 140-2 [Level 2] - a US security standard. 

- What is CMK? Customer Master Key is like a logical container that is managed by KMS. It contains key ID, d ata, resource policy, description, and a state of the key. Physicl key material is held by KM and this backs CMK - physical key material is either generated by KMS or imported to KMS but it is used to encrypt and decrypt things. CMKs can be used tod encrypt or decrypt data up to 4KB of data. AWS managed CMKs have aliases already and cannot be modified. The name pattern is aws/service-name; aws/s3 or aws/ssm, etc.

- What is the difference between HSM and KSM? 

- What is the cost for for CloudHSM?

- What is key rotation? Automatic rotation is enabled to rotate the key every 3 years for AWS Managed CMKs. You cannot modify this setting.

- How much do KMS keys cost?
